# Cardiovascular Prediction Model
## Objective
It's undeniable that cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the world. Various factors such as age, cholesterol level, and unhealthy lifestyle can trigger cardiovascular disease. The symptoms of cardiovascular disease are also challenging to identify. This research use logistic regression algorithm to find the interrelation between dependent variable and independent variable involved. With this project, it is expected to be able to increase readers' knowledge and insight related to how to analyze cardiovascular disease using logistic regression algorithm.

## Data
In this project, Heart Disease UCI Dataset published by Ronit in Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) will be used. A dataset consisting of 14 variables with 76 attributes and 304 responses was used as the basis for identification as a link between factors that cause cardiovascular disease.
### Data Description
-   age
-   gender => 0 means female, 1 means male
-   chest pain
-   trestbps => resting blood pressure in mmHg
-   chol => chol-serum cholesterol in mg/dl
-   fbs => blood sugar when fasting (0 means false, 1 means true)
-   restecg => resting electrocardiographic outcome
-   thalac => maximum thalac heart rate
-   exang => exacting-exercise variable induced angina (0 means no, 1 means yes)
-   oldpeak => depression caused by exercise relative to rest
-   slope => slope of the peak training segment
-   ca => ca-number of main vessels with values 0 to 3 colored by fluoroscopy
-   thal => 3 means normal, 6 means permanent disability, 7 means reversible defects
-   target
-
